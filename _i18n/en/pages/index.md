This site is fan-run limited-time site dedicated to introducing the "calls" for Konomi Suzuki's songs.

## For Starters

Thank you for visiting this site. For the upcoming concert **Konomi Suzuki Live 2020 ~Single Collection~** on October 9, 2020, we have curated a selection of songs with a lot of calls and call-and-responses.

Let's all follow **social distancing guidelines** and enjoy the concert!!

## Terminology

### Calls

"Calls" refer to acts like clapping and shouting to the rhythm of a song to liven up the atmosphere during a concert. If everyone in the venue acts in the same way, a sense of unity amongst all the participants. However, it is not compulsary; it is merely one way to enjoy the concert.

For example, the <hi...!> listed at the prelude and interlude on the song pages refers to shouting "hi!" according to the rhythm.

### Call and Response

A "call and response" is a musical dialogue. By having the audience sing part of the lyrics, it helps to create a sense of unity amongst the participants, like with calls. Of course, these are not compulsary either. Text that is **bolded** on the song pages signify sections that the audience (us) can sing.
