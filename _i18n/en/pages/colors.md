Here is a list of all the song image colors that Konomin has publicly stated in the last on her blog or at events.

**Note**  
It is by no means a requirement to wave penlights or cyalume, or even use the "correct" color light during a concert.

To match the theme of the concert, only **singles and their respective B-sides** are listed here.
